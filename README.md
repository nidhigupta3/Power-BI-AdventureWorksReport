This Power BI project is a comprehensive analysis and visualization of Adventure Works, a fictional global manufacturing company producing cycling equipment and accessories.

The **brief** is that the management team needs a way to:
• Track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns)
• Compare regional performance
• Analyze product-level trends, and
• Identify high-value customers

The **dataset** consists of 10 CSV files and was provided with the [Maven Analytics Power BI Desktop course](https://mavenanalytics.io/course/microsoft-power-bi-desktop). 
The customer base is spread across 6 countries on 3 continents: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, United Kingdom, and the United States. Sales and Return data are available for the period between 01/01/2020 and 06/30/2022. Customer details include Birth Date, Marital Status, Gender, Annual Income, Email ID, Education Level, Number Of Children, Occupation, and Home-owner Status.

The **objective** is to use the Power BI Desktop to:
• Connect and transform the raw data
• Build a relational data model
• Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
• Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data

## **Tools and Technologies**
 
• Power BI Desktop: For dashboard creation
• Power Query: Data transformation and data cleaning
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Creation of calculated columns and measures
• Excel: Initial data exploration and validation

## **Project Highlights**
The project involved the following steps:
**1. Data Transformation: Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query**
• The data was provided in csv format files for Customer Details, Product Categories, Product Sub-categories, Territories, Sales, and Returns.
• It is checked and cleaned for duplicates, error and tranformations were performed to create calculated columns and measures with common functions and formulas.
• It is ensured that all columns had clear titles, appropriate data types, and no missing values.
• This process also involved identifying potential relationships between different data tables.
• A rolling calendar is created using PowerQuery M code.

**2. Data Modeling: Created relationships and calculated columns for effective analysis**
• Built a relational data model by creating active relations between tables and understanding cardinality and filter flow.
• This involved establishing the 'Sales Data' and 'Returns Data' tables as the foundation, and one-to-many connections between tables were used for analysis.

**3. Calculated fields with DAX**
• Creating calculated columns and measures using DAX
 
**4. Dashboard Development: Built interactive dashboards tailored to stakeholder needs.**
• Producing analytical Reports: Detailed reports focusing on sales performance, customer demographics, inventory management, and more.
  Visualizing data with reports
  • Building a relational data model: Well-structured data models that integrate various data sources for a holistic view of the business.
 • Building an interactive dashboard: Customized dashboards providing insightful metrics and KPIs relevant to the bike shop's operations.
 • Visualizations: A range of visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and maps, offering intuitive data interpretations.
 Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize data using charts and visuals: KPI cards, Matrix, Slicers, Bar chart, Line and clustered column chart, Gauge, Map etc.
Created Bookmarks, drill-through filters and page level, report level filters.

This project serves as a showcase of advanced Power BI techniques and offers a deep dive into the business analytics of a retail bike shop.

## **Data Visualizations for Adventure Works Analysis**
